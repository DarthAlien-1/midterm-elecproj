## Implemented Image Processing Features

### Thermal Vision (Heatmap)
Applies a JET colormap to visualize intensity variations within the image.

### Motion Blur (Directional)
Creates a horizontal motion blur effect using a custom kernel for dynamic visuals.

### Mirror Flip (Horizontal)
Flips images horizontally for mirror reflection effects.

### Channel Swap (BGR → RGB)
Converts OpenCV's BGR color space to standard RGB color format.

### Solarize
Inverts pixels with brightness above 128 for a solarization effect.

### Rotate 90° Clockwise
Rotates images 90 degrees in the clockwise direction.

## How to Use the Automated Image Processing System

### 1. Upload/Input Images
- Place the image or images you want to process inside the input_images folder.  
- Supported image formats include .jpg, .png, and .jpeg.

### 2. Program Start
- Run the processor script:
python processor.py
- The system automatically processes all images found in the input_images folder.

### 3. Automated Processing
Each input image undergoes the following operations:
- Thermal Vision (Heatmap)  
- Motion Blur (Directional)  
- Mirror Flip (Horizontal)  
- Channel Swap (BGR → RGB)  
- Solarize  
- Rotate 90° Clockwise

### 4. Output Results
- All processed images are automatically saved in the output_images folder.  
- Each image processing feature generates its own output file with a descriptive prefix for easy comparison and validation.

### 5. Automation and Continuous Integration
- Automated tests are executed using PyTest.  
- Every push or pull request triggers the GitHub Actions CI pipeline to ensure code quality and reliability.
